Generated Readme.md

## Description

In this homework I created a README.md generator using node.js. The readme will display their project name, license, a description of the project, how the user should use the project, who contributed and ways to reach the creator.

## Usage

The user will be asked a series of questions in their terminal and the answers will be used to populate the neceassary areas on the Readme.

## What I Used

To complete this homework I ran an npm init and npm install in oreder to use inquier and dotenv.
Shield.io was used to the license badge.
Everything was written in the same JS file.
